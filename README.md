## Transport Protocol over UDP - Lab Assignments
This repository contains lab assignments focused on developing a reliable and efficient transport protocol on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The assignments are divided into multiple parts, including theoretical discussions, simulations, and implementations.

### Lab 1: Unix Socket Programming
This lab provides a basic introduction to Unix socket programming. You will learn how to create a simple client-server setup using Unix sockets, handle multiple clients, send messages, and modify the code to add additional features, such as broadcasting messages to all connected clients and selectively refusing connections from specific clients.

### Lab 2: Sliding Window Protocol Simulation
In this lab, you will simulate the sliding window protocol to gain a deeper understanding of the protocol and data communication in general. The lab involves using a provided simulation tool to set various parameters, such as frame size, link speed, number of frames, propagation delay, and window size. You will analyze the simulation results and draw conclusions about the protocol's performance under different conditions.

### Lab 3: Implementing a Reliable Transport Protocol over UDP
The goal of this assignment is to create a reliable and efficient transport protocol on top of UDP. You will develop a protocol stack on top of UDP that provides connection setup and teardown, a sliding window mechanism for efficiency, and an error check mechanism. Both a client and a server should be implemented, preferably in C. The assignment consists of two parts: theoretical discussions with state-machine diagrams and the actual implementation of the transport protocol.
