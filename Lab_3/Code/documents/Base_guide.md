### Base Implementation
**Create a UDP socket:** Implement a function to create a UDP socket, bind it to an address and port (for the server), and set the necessary options.

**Implement error generator:** Create a function that simulates packet loss, corruption, and out-of-order delivery by altering packet data, dropping packets, or reordering them.

**Packet structure:** Define a struct to represent a packet with fields for sequence number, acknowledgement number, flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.), error check code, payload data, and payload length.

**Connection setup and teardown:** Implement a three-way handshake similar to TCP for establishing a connection. Use SYN, SYN+ACK, and ACK packets. For teardown, use FIN and ACK packets.

**Sliding window mechanism:** Implement the selective repeat sliding window mechanism to manage the transmission and reception of packets efficiently. Keep track of the base sequence number, next expected sequence number, and window size.

**Error check mechanism:** Implement a function to calculate the error check code (e.g., CRC or checksum) for each packet, considering both header and payload data.

**Handle packet issues:** Design the protocol to handle lost, corrupt, and out-of-order packets during data transmission, connection setup, and connection teardown.

### Testing and Debugging
**Simulate packet issues:** Use the error generator function to inject packet loss, corruption, and out-of-order delivery into the program.

**Test the implementation:** Test the protocol by transferring data between a client and server, observing how the protocol handles different error scenarios.

**Debug and refine:** Use debugging tools (e.g., gdb, valgrind) and print statements to identify and fix issues in the implementation. Refine the protocol based on testing results.
